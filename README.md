# Demission Calculator
- 18 December 2012

My first cross-platform program. The purpose of the program is to calculate the aspect ratio of a rectangle (screen or image), based on the size of its sides in pixels. The idea of creating a program came to my mind when I tried to tweak a very strangely cropped photo (186 x 83) without losing quality for a pda screen (800 x 600). It turned out that it's really hard to calculate, so I had to increase the “canvas” of the image. But this case allowed me to write for the first time a working program in the Free Pascal language, which subsequently made it possible to compile the program for various platforms.
